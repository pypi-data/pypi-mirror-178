Flood Risk Prediction tool
==========================

Deadlines
---------

-  *code 12pm GMT Friday 25th November 2022*
-  *presentation/ one page report 4pm GMT Friday 25th November 2022*

Key Requirements
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Your project must provide the following:

-  at least one analysis method to estimate a number of properties for
   unlabelled postcodes extrapolated from sample data which is provided
   to you:

   -  Flood risk (on a 10 point scale).
   -  Median house price.

-  at least one analysis method to estimate the Local Authority & flood
   risk of arbitrary locations.
-  a method to find the rainfall and water level near a given postcode
   from provided rainfall, river and tide level data, or by looking
   online.

You should also provide visualization and analysis tools for the
postcode, rainfall, river & tide data provided to you, ideally in a way
which will identify potential areas at immediate risk of flooding.

Your code should have installation instructions and basic documentation,
either as docstrings for functions & class methods, a full manual or
both.

|London postcode density| |England Flood Risk| |UK soil types|

This README file *should be updated* over the course of your groupâ€™s
work to represent the scope and abilities of your project.

Assessment
~~~~~~~~~~

-  your code will be assessed for its speed (both at training and
   prediction) & accuracy.
-  Your code should include tests of its functionality.
-  Additional marks will be awarded for high code quality and a clean,
   well organised repository.

Documentation
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

*This section should be updated during the week.*

The code includes `Sphinx <https://www.sphinx-doc.org>`__ documentation.
On systems with Sphinx installed, this can be build by running

::

   python -m sphinx docs html

then viewing the generated ``index.html`` file in the ``html`` directory
in your browser.

For systems with `LaTeX <https://www.latex-project.org/get/>`__
installed, a manual pdf can be generated by running

.. code:: bash

   python -m sphinx  -b latex docs latex

Then following the instructions to process the ``FloodTool.tex`` file in
the ``latex`` directory in your browser.

Testing
~~~~~~~

The tool includes several tests, which you can use to check its
operation on your system. With
`pytest <https://doc.pytest.org/en/latest>`__ installed, these can be
run with

.. code:: bash

   python -m pytest --doctest-modules flood_tool

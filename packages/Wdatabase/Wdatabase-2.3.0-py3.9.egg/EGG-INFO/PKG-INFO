              on behalf of whom a Contribution has been received by Licensor and
              subsequently incorporated within the Work.
        
           2. Grant of Copyright License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
              this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
              worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
              copyright license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of,
              publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute the

           3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
              this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,

              (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made,
              use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work,
              where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable
              by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their
              Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)
              with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You
              institute patent litigation against any entity (including a
              cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work
              or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct
              or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
              granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
              as of the date such litigation is filed.
        
           4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the
              Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without
              modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You
              meet the following conditions:
        
              (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or
                  Derivative Works a copy of this License; and
        
              (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices
                  stating that You changed the files; and
        
              (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works
                  that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and
                  attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,
                  excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
                  the Derivative Works; and
        
              (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its
                  distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
                  include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
                  within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
                  pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
                  of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
                  as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
                  documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
                  within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
                  wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
                  of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
                  do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
                  notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
                  or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
                  that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
                  as modifying the License.
        
              You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
              may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
              for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
              for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
              reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
              the conditions stated in this License.
        
           5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
              any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
              by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
              this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
              Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
              the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
              with Licensor regarding such Contributions.
        
           6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
              names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
              except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
              origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.
        
           7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
              agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
              Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
              WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
              implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
              of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
              PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
              appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
              risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.
        
           8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
              whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
              unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
              negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
              liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
              incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
              result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
              Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
              work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
              other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
              has been advised of the possibility of such damages.
        
           9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
              the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
              and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
              or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
              License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
              on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
              of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
              defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
              incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
              of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.
        
           END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS
        
           APPENDIX: How to apply the Apache License to your work.
        
              To apply the Apache License to your work, attach the following
              boilerplate notice, with the fields enclosed by brackets "[]"

# Features

This project is a dataset with multiple functions, there are many datasets in it, and it has been uploaded to Pypi.



# Download
This project uses Pypi, so it is recommended to use Pypi to download
There are some dependent libraries, please paste the following code into the terminal

```
pip3 install simplejson
pip3 install openpyxl
pip3 install matplotlib
pip3 install setuptools
```
Code: `pip3 install Wdatabase`

# Use

The package name when we upload is not the same as the package name used in actual use
When importing, use the following code

````python
from Wdata import WdataMain as main
````
The main class has the following functions:

| Functions | Introduction |       Syntax       | Return Type |
|:---------:|:------------:|:------------------:|:-----------:|
|   draw    |    Draw      |      Func()        |    None     |
| Save_file |  Save file   | Func(filename:str, type='json', Sheet='Data', RowOrColumn=True)                 |    bool     |
## Import Data
Wdata has a lot of data sets, here we use 200 years of population growth data as an example

The syntax of Wdata_class is as follows:
`WdataMain(json_fname: str)`

`json_fname` is the name of the dataset

````python
from Wdata import WdataMain as main

test = main('Population_growth')  # import population growth over 200 years
````

## Get data
We can use the `dict()` function to fetch the data

such as these codes

````python
from Wdata import WdataMain as main

test = main('Population_growth')  # import population growth over 200 years
print(dict(test))
````

after running
```shell
~/python test.py
{
    '1800': 900000000,
    '1820': 1100000000,
    '1840': 1200000000,
    '1860': 1300000000,
    '1880': 1400000000,
    '1900': 1650000000,
    '1920': 1800000000,
    '1940': 2200000000,
    '1960': 3000000000,
    '1980': 4400000000,
    '2000': 5900000000,
    '2022': 7400000000
    }
````
## Drawing
Drawing functions use the `draw()` function
as the following code

````python
from Wdata import WdataMain as main

test = main('Population_growth')  # import population growth over 200 years
test.draw()
````
The result is this
<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Wdataorg/Wdata/main/img/draw_pop.jpg"></img>

## Data save
You can use the `Save_file()` function to save data

The syntax of `Save_file` is `Save_file(filename:str, type=JSON, Sheet='Data',RowOrColumn=True) -> None`

Parameter description:
The `filename` 'parameter is used to describe saving a file
The `type` 'parameter is used to describe the file type
`Sheet` only takes effect when saving a `.xlsx` file, representing a saved worksheet

`RowOrColumn` only takes effect when saving a `.xlsx` file, indicating the saved format
The file types are as follows:

|File Type | Usage | Description|
|:---:|:---:|:---:|
|Csv | Wdata.CSV | Save File ` file.csv`|
|Json | Wdata.JSON | Save the file `file. json` as the default option|
|XLSX|Wdata.XLSX|Save File `file.xlsx`|

Such as the following code

```python
from Wdata import WdataMain as main
test = main('Population_growth') 
test. Save_file('Package_test') # Default option
```

Save the code for the `CSV` file

```python
from Wdata import WdataMain as main
from Wdata import XLSX
test = main('Population_growth') # Population growth over the past 200 years
test. Save_file('Package_test', CSV) # The function automatically adds .csv suffix
```

Saving `.xlsx` files uses the `Sheet` and `RowOrColumn` parameters

`Sheet` means save cell, which defaults to `Data`

`RowOrColumn` means saved form, defaulting to `True`

```python
from Wdata import WdataMain as main
from Wdata import XLSX
test = main('Population_growth') # Population growth over the past 200 years
test. Save_file('Package_test', XLSX) # This function automatically adds .xlsx suffix
# test. Save_file('Package_test', XLSX, RowOrColumn=False) This code is saved as a column
```

When `RowOrColumn` is `True`, the saved form looks like this

| 1820 |1840 | 1860 | 1880 | 1900 | 1920 | 1940 |1960|1980 | 2000 |2022|
|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|
|1100000000|1200000000|1300000000|1400000000|1650000000|1800000000|2200000000|3000000000|4400000000|5900000000|7400000000|

On the contrary, it is like this

| 1820 | 1100000000 | 
|:---:|:---:|
|1840 |1200000000|
|1860|1300000000|
|1880|1400000000|
|1900|1650000000|
|1920|1800000000|
|1940|2200000000|
|1960|3000000000|

# Additional Features
## Cosine similarity function
The cosine similarity function can calculate the cosine similarity of two coordinates in two-dimensional space according to the cosine similarity formula
usage method:
```python
from Wdata import mathfunc
Xy1=(2, 3) # First coordinate
Xy2=(3, 5) # Second coordinate
Result=mathfunc.similarity (xy1, xy2) # Cosine similarity
print(result)
```
## Distance formula
Distance formula Use Euclid distance formula to calculate the distance between two coordinates in two-dimensional space
usage method:
```python
from Wdata import mathfunc
xy1 = (2, 3)
xy2 = (3, 5)
Result=mathfunc.distance (xy1, xy2) # Distance formula
print(result)
```

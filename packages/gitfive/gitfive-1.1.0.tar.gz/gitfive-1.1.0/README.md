# Description

GitFive is an OSINT tool to investigate GitHub profiles.

Main features :
- Usernames / names history
- Usernames / names variations
- Email address to GitHub account
- Find GitHub's accounts from a list of email addresses
- Lists identities used by the target
- Clones and analyze every target's repos
- Highlights emails tied to GitHub's target account
- Finds local identities (UPNs, ex : jeanpierre@My-Computer.local)
- Finds potential secondary GitHub accounts
- Don't need repos to work (but better)
- Generates every possible email address combinations and looks for matchs
- Dumps SSH public keys
- JSON export

Optimizations :
- Very low API consumption, stays under the rate-limit
- Multi-processing tasks (bypassing Python's GIL)
- Async scraping

    """
    The global lock for all pipelines. If the pipelines are locked
    via Lock.global_lock(), the pipelines of all dataframes will stop
    being updated. Depending on the operation, they might not be preserved.
    This increases the speed of access to the dataframe, which is
    especially critical if many indexing / slicing operations are performed.

    The user may opt to lock the dataframe with a context manager, i.e. via:
    with qk.Lock.lock():
        print('All pipelines are locked!')
    print('All pipelines are unlocked!')

    Otherwise, the lock / unlock functionality can be used directly:
    qk.Lock.global_lock()
    print('All pipelines are locked!')
    qk.Lock.global_unlock()
    print('All pipelines are unlocked!')

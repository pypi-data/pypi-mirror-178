Description-Content-Type: text/markdown

This package provides web services for the VOLTTRONâ„¢ platform.
This includes a RESTful API for interacting with the platform
and utility pages for administration and certificate management.
This library cannot be installed as a VOLTTRON agent is.
Rather, it must be installed as a python package.

[![pypi version](https://img.shields.io/pypi/v/volttron-lib-web.svg)](https://pypi.org/project/volttron-lib-web/)

## Requirements
* python >=3.8
* volttron >= 10.0

## Installation with Web
This library can be installed using pip:

```bash
> pip install volttron-lib-web
```

Once the library is installed, VOLTTRON will not be able to start until the
web service is configured. Configurations for services, including this, reside
in a service_config.yml file in the VOLTTRON_HOME directory
(by default ~/.volttron/service_config.yml).
If this file does not already exist, create it. To configure the web service,
include the following:

```yaml
volttron.services.web:
  enabled: true
  kwargs:
    bind_web_address: http://127.0.0.156:5467
    web_secret_key: some_string # If not using SSL.
    web_ssl_cert: /path/to/certificate # Path to the SSL certificate to be used by the web service. 
    web_ssl_key: /path/to/key # Path to the SSL secret key file used by web service.
```

If using SSL, both web_ssl_certificate and web_ssl_key are required
and web_secret_key should not be included. If SSL is not desired,
provide a web_secret_key instead and remove the lines for the web_ssl_cert
and web_ssl_key.

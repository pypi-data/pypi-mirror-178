---

  * The `lastfm` module has new documentation and bug fixes.
    :mr:`214`
  * Issues with Pip + Meson installs from sdist and Git repo are resolved.
    :mr:`213`

8.1
---

  * Examples are now included in the ``calliope_music`` distribution and
    installed as a separate ``calliope_examples`` package. The "Special Mix"
    example can now be executed directly after installation:

    .. code:: bash

        python3 -m calliope_examples.special_mix

  * Meson is now used as the project build system for Python package builds.
    All setuptools configuration has been removed. There should be no
    functional difference with this change.
    :mr:`211`

8.0
---

  * Multiple artists are now returned when you resolve or annotate via
    MusicBrainz and Spotify. This is a change in the data format for
    those subcommands: fields such as `artist_id` are replaced by a
    `artists` list.
    :mr:`205`
  * musicbrainz: The ``annotate --include`` option now supports all values that
    the `MusicBrainz API <https://musicbrainz.org/doc/MusicBrainz_API#Subqueries>`_
    supports.

       * See the full list of keys with ``cpe musicbrainz list-includes``
       * Use ``*`` to select many keys, e.g. ``--include=artist.*`` to select
         all data related to the artist.

    :mr:`200`
  * Other Musicbrainz improvements:

       * The ``annotate`` command no longer calls ``search()`` unless required.
       * More detailed artist data is returned.
         :mr:`201`
       * Fix crash if :func:`calliope.musicbrainz.annotate` is called
         without the ``select_fn`` parameter.

# InstaReset - _Forgot Instagram Password_ using Python !

<br>

## What is this?
This script was made to send a Instagram reset password request using Python **without asking for reCAPTCHA** as Instagram does if we used a browser, It supports username and email methods.

<br>

## How it works ?
This script works by using a faked mobile user agent like `Instagram 150.0.0.0.000 Android (29/10; 300dpi; 720x1440)` and send a POST request to `https://i.instagram.com/api/v1/accounts/send_password_reset/` _with a random generated CSRF token of 32 chars_ in the request data.

<br>

## Features
- Faster ‚ö°
- No reCAPTCHA ü§ñ
- Nice looking CLI üé®
- Works on mobile üì±

<br>

## Requirements
- [Python 3.6.3 or higher](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
- [Requests](https://pypi.org/project/requests/) module `pip install requests`
- [Rich](https://pypi.org/project/rich/) module `pip install rich`

<br>

## Installation

The source code is now available on [PyPi](https://pypi.org/project/instareset/) so you can install it using `pip`:

```bash
pip install instareset
```

<br>

## Module version usage (New in v2.0.0)

```python
from instareset import InstaReset

# Create an instance of InstaReset
ir = InstaReset()

# Send a reset password request
ir.send_request('username or email')
```

`send_request` might raise `InvalidUsernameException`, `RateLimitedException`, or `UsernameNotFoundException` which can be imported from `instareset.exceptions`.

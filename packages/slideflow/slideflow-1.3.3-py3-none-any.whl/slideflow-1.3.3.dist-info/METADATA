Slideflow provides a unified API for building and testing deep learning models for digital pathology, supporting both Tensorflow and PyTorch.

Slideflow includes tools for **whole-slide image processing** and tile extraction, **customizable deep learning model training** with dozens of supported architectures, **explainability tools** including heatmaps, mosaic maps, GANs, and saliency maps, **analysis of activations** from model layers, **uncertainty quantification**, and more. A variety of fast, optimized whole-slide image processing tools are included, including background filtering, blur/artifact detection, [stain normalization](https://slideflow.dev/norm.html), and efficient storage in `*.tfrecords` format. Model training is easy and highly configurable, with an easy drop-in API for training custom architectures. For external training loops, Slideflow can be used as an image processing backend, serving an optimized `tf.data.Dataset` or `torch.utils.data.DataLoader` to read and process slide images and perform real-time stain normalization.

## Updates (1.3.2)
Please see the [Version 1.3.2 Release Notes](https://github.com/jamesdolezal/slideflow/releases/tag/1.3.2) for a summary of the latest updates and fixes in the latest release.

## Installation
Slideflow can be installed with PyPI, as a Docker container, or run from source. 

### Method 1: Install via pip

```
pip3 install --upgrade setuptools pip wheel
pip3 install slideflow
```

### Method 2: Docker image

Alternatively, pre-configured [docker images](https://hub.docker.com/repository/docker/jamesdolezal/slideflow) are available with OpenSlide/Libvips and the latest version of either Tensorflow and PyTorch. To install with the Tensorflow backend:

```
docker pull jamesdolezal/slideflow:latest-tf
docker run -it --gpus all jamesdolezal/slideflow:latest-tf
```

To install with the PyTorch backend:

```
docker pull jamesdolezal/slideflow:latest-torch
docker run -it --shm-size=2g --gpus all jamesdolezal/slideflow:latest-torch
```

### Method 3: From source

To run from source, clone this repository, install the conda development environment, and build a wheel:

```
git clone https://github.com/jamesdolezal/slideflow
cd slideflow
conda env create -f environment.yml
conda activate slideflow
python setup.py bdist_wheel
pip install dist/slideflow*
```

## Getting started
Slideflow experiments are organized into [Projects](https://slideflow.dev/project_setup.html), which supervise storage of whole-slide images, extracted tiles, and patient-level annotations. To create a new project, create an instance of the `slideflow.Project` class, supplying a pre-configured set of patient-level annotations in CSV format:

```python
import slideflow as sf
P = sf.Project(
  '/project/path',
  annotations="/patient/annotations.csv"
)
```

Once the project is created, add a new dataset source with paths to whole-slide images, tumor Region of Interest (ROI) files [if applicable], and paths to where extracted tiles/tfrecords should be stored. This will only need to be done once.

```python
P.add_source(
  name="TCGA",
  slides="/slides/directory",
  roi="/roi/directory",
  tiles="/tiles/directory",
  tfrecords="/tfrecords/directory"
)
```

This step should attempt to automatically associate slide names with the patient identifiers in your annotations file. After this step has completed, double check that the annotations file has a `slide` column for each annotation entry with the filename (without extension) of the corresponding slide.

## Extract tiles from slides

Next, whole-slide images are segmented into smaller image tiles and saved in `*.tfrecords` format. [Extract tiles](https://slideflow.dev/extract_tiles.html) from slides at a given magnification (width in microns size) and resolution (width in pixels) using `sf.Project.extract_tiles()`:

```python
P.extract_tiles(
  tile_px=299,  # Tile size, in pixels
  tile_um=302   # Tile size, in microns
)
```

If slides are on a network drive or a spinning HDD, tile extraction can be accelerated by buffering slides to a SSD or ramdisk:

```python
P.extract_tiles(
  ...,
  buffer="/mnt/ramdisk"
)
```

## Training models

Once tiles are extracted, models can be [trained](https://slideflow.dev/training.html). Start by configuring a set of [hyperparameters](https://slideflow.dev/model.html#modelparams):

```python
params = sf.ModelParams(
  tile_px=299,
  tile_um=302,
  batch_size=32,
  model='xception',
  learning_rate=0.0001,
  ...
)
```

Models can then be trained using these parameters. Models can be trained to categorical, multi-categorical, continuous, or time-series outcomes, and the training process is [highly configurable](https://slideflow.dev/training.html). For example, to train models in cross-validation to predict the outcome `'category1'` as stored in the project annotations file:

```python
P.train(
  'category1',
  params=params,
  save_predictions=True,
  multi_gpu=True
)
```

## Evaluation, heatmaps, mosaic maps, and more

Slideflow includes a host of additional tools, including model [evaluation](https://slideflow.dev/evaluation.html) and [prediction](https://slideflow.dev/project.html#slideflow.Project.predict), [heatmaps](https://slideflow.dev/project.html#slideflow.Project.generate_heatmaps), [mosaic maps](https://slideflow.dev/project.html#slideflow.Project.generate_mosaic), analysis of [layer activations](https://slideflow.dev/layer_activations.html), and more. See our [full documentation](https://slideflow.dev) for more details and tutorials.

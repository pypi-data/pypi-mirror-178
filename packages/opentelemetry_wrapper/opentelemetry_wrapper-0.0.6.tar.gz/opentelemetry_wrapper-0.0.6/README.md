# opentelemetry_wrapper

a wrapper around `opentelemetry` and `opentelemetry-instrumentation-*` to make life a bit easier

## what this does (or is supposed to do)

* Make instrumentation (more) idempotent
* Make re-instrumentation of logging actually work with different format strings
* Make `logging` print as a one-line JSON dict by default
* Provide support for decorating functions and classes
* Provide support for instrumentation of dataclasses
  * Global instrumentation needs to be run *before* any dataclasses are initialized
  * Otherwise, use the decorator on each class as usual (it's idempotent anyway)
* Add global instrumentation of FastAPI
  * sometimes works even after apps are created for some reason, likely due to how Uvicorn runs in a new process
  * but somehow sometimes doesn't work in prod, for equally unknown reasons
  * probably best to instrument each app instance
* logs some http headers received by fastapi as span attributes

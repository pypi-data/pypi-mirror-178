"""
This file contains base components for handler development.

A 'handler' is something that 'handles' data from a specific source of a specific type.
Essentially, when data comes from a specific source,
the handler is the thing that gets and formats that data into something that is easy to work with.
A handler may also fetch data from elsewhere to fill in the blanks.

In this file, we outline some of the functionality of a handler,
and layout certain components that it will need to play nicely with everything else.

Because handlers can do a large variety of things,
the specific implementation is left ambiguous.

By default, the HandlerCollection only works with the 'handle' method,
which will accept raw data from the service we are talking to.
There will be other components that the handler can override if necessary.

    """
    BaseHandler - Child class all handlers must inherit!

    We offer some basic methods that a handler should inherit,
    as well as define the cappy Handler Framework(CHF).

    Essentially, the function makeup of the CHF is this:

        * make_proto - Should return a valid protocol object for this handler
        * proto_call - Call to the protocol of this handler, should return valid raw data
        * pre_process - Decodes data from the protocol before being send to the handler
        * format - Method called for formatting raw data from the protocol
        * post_process - Finalizes the formatted data(Adds metadata, raw data, ect.)
        * handle - Invokes the handling process for this handler

    This allows handlers to control many aspects of their implementation.
    With smart inheritance, it also removes a lot of repeated calls and instructions.
    These functions are called in the order defined above.
    Everything from getting information to formatting can be customized. 

    Handlers are identified by instance types.
    Instance types are simply an integer that represents what this handler does.

    The handle method is the entry point for handlers.
    It will accept the arguments and information from the handler collection,
    and will work with them as necessary.
    The default handle method will call all components in order,
    so it is a good idea to use 'super()' once you have configured your methods.
    You can configure the handle method to accept any arguments you like, 
    the HandlerCollection will pass all arguments that it receives to the 'handle' method,
    so you should use this as the primary way to accept arguments. 

    The handler ID will be stored under the ID parameter.
    Unidentified handlers will have an ID of -1.
    Handlers must be identified if they are to be used for handler processes!

    These handlers are designed to be customizable!
    The CHF is designed to be a good default implementation,
    that minimizes the amount of code developers have to write for handler development.

    Don't like the CHF? No problem!
    Most of the functions defined here are not necessary for handlers to work!
    The only functions that NEED to be defined are 'handle' and 'make_proto'.
    This means you can define your own methods and frameworks by creating a custom 'handle' method,
    that can call/do anything you would like it too.

                }
            )

        * 0 - Hand1
        * 1 - Hand1
        * 2 - Hand1
        * 4 - Hand2

        Notice, that even though Hand2 was assigned to ID's 0 and 2,
        it was not used, as Hand1 had a higher priority.
        However, ID 4 had no handlers assigned to it,
        so Hand2 was allowed to associate with it.

        Here is another example, and instead of utilizing
        dictionaries for skipped indexes, we simply use a NullHandler as a placeholder:

        .. code-block::

            (
                (
                    Hand1(),
                    Hand1(),
                    NullHandler(),
                    Hand1()
                ),
                (
                    Hand2(),
                    NullHandler(),
                    Hand2(),
                )
            )

        In this example, we do not assign a handler for the 2nd index
        in the first priority handler map, and instead assign a NullHandler in it's place.
        Because NullHandlers are ALWAYS a lower priority,
        the lower priorities will overrite them, even though they have been specified.
        This allows users to skip ID's without having to use dictionaries.

        We use 'add_handler()' under the hood,
        and we use recursion to iterate over the handlers.

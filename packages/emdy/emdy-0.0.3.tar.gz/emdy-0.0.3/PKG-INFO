# Emdy

Emdy generates Markdown-formattted open source and Creative Commons licenses from your command line.

## Installation

### pipx (recommended)

The recommended, cross-platform way of installing Emdy is via [pipx](https://pypa.github.io/pipx/).

```bash
pipx install emdy
```

### Homebrew (macOS and Linux)

A [Homebrew](https://brew.sh) formula for Emdy is available from
the [Houkago Tea Tap](https://github.com/celsiusnarhwal/homebrew-htt).

```bash
brew tap celsiusnarhwal/htt
brew install emdy
```

### pip (not recommended)

Emdy can be installed via pip like any other Python package, but unless you're going to create a virtual environment
for it yourself, you're strongly recommeded to use pipx or Homebrew.

```bash
pip install emdy
```

## Usage

Simply invoke Emdy from the command line:

```bash
emdy
```

That's it. Emdy will interactively guide you through the rest.

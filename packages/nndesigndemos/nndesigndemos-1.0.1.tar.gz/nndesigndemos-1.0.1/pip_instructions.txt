1. Create account on https://pypi.org/account/register/

2. Make a directory with your project name. Create a README.md in this directory.

3. Make another directory inside this one with the name of the package. Do not use "-" nor capital letters. This directory will contain almost all the code and static files.

4. The main file should be named package_name.py (I don't think this is necessary)

4. Create an __init__.py:
from package_name.main_file_name import (
  function_name,  #Â function_name for us is the function that starts the GUI
)
This means that when it's installed, you can do import package_name; package_name.function_name.

5. Create a setup.py:

import setuptools


setuptools.setup(
    author="",
    author_email="",
    name='package_name',
    license="MIT",
    description='',
    version='v0.0.1',
    long_description='',
    url='github_url',
    packages=["package_name"],
    include_package_data=True,
    python_requires=">=3.5",
    install_requires=["dependencies"],
    classifiers=[
        # Trove classifiers
        # (https://pypi.python.org/pypi?%3Aaction=list_classifiers)
        'Development Status :: 4 - Beta',
        'License :: OSI Approved :: MIT License',
        'Programming Language :: Python',
        'Programming Language :: Python :: 3.7',
        'Topic :: Software Development :: Libraries',
        'Intended Audience :: Developers',
    ],
)

6. nano ~/.pypirc

[distutils]
index-servers =
  pypi
  testpypi
[pypi]
username: username
password: password

7. nano MANIFEST.in in the same level that setup.py

include README.md
recursive-include package_name/static_files_folder *

8. python setup.py sdist bdist_wheel

9. twine upload dist/*

To add release comments, do: twine upload -c "comment" dist/* -> actually this does not work :/

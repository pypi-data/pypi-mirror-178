# CMS-NBI-CLIENT

CMS-NBI-CLIENT is a python package in the works. This package is not owned, supported or endorsed by Calix. 
The goal of this package is to interact with the multiple NBIs(Northbound Interfaces) provided by a CMS(Calix Management System) instance.
Current scope of work is focused on the EXA line of E7 nodes. If you require work on other Calix products, feel free to put in a pull request.

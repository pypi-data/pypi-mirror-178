## Autentication and authorization Overview
This package will be published on PyPi as downloadable package.
The main purpose of it is to Oauth2 authenticate a user of the Jupiter Notebook (**JpN**) that will need access to Google Sheets application. The security context is the current macOS user who use the Jupiter notebook and is logged in with Google's account.
In order to ustilize the Google's Sheets API the JpN code would need to:
</br>

- enable Google Sheet API in the GCP project where the application is registered.
- install the package `fore` from PyPi;
- recieve a file `credentials.json` from her line manager and copy it to `~/crgoauth` folder. This file contains the JpN application's credentials. The security context for the credentials is `https://www.googleapis.com/auth/spreadsheets`;
- Logging in the Cloudreach's google account and in the prompted window authorized the JpN application to access the Google Sheets API.


### HowTos

---
describe the front-end and back-end building systems. Adds up the relevant metadata too.
</br>

step-2: *install build*

```
</br>

step-3: *run the build process*
---
Now run this command from the same directory where pyproject.toml is located:
```bash
   python3 -m build
```
</br>

step-4: *upload to PyPi using twine*

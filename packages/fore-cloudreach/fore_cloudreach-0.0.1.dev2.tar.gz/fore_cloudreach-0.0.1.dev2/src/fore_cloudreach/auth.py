# ===
# The following steps show how your application interacts with Google's OAuth 2.0 server to obtain 
# a user's consent to perform an API request on the user's behalf. 
# Your application must have that consent before it can execute a Google API request that 
# requires user authorization.
#
# The list below quickly summarizes these steps:
# 
# 1. Your application identifies the permissions it needs.
# 2. Your application redirects the user to Google along with the list of requested permissions.
# 3. The user decides whether to grant the permissions to your application.
# 4. Your application finds out what the user decided.
# 5. If the user granted the requested permissions, your application retrieves tokens needed to make 
#    API requests on the user's behalf.

    """
    Default local clustering algorithm.

    Given a graph and starting vertex, return a cluster which is close to the
    starting vertex. The ``target_volume`` parameter controls the size of the
    returned cluster.

    You should set ``target_volume`` to be your best guess for the volume of the
    cluster you would like to find. For example, the following code will find
    one of the 'clusters' in a barbell graph.

    The ACL local clustering algorithm.

      be. A value of :math:`1` will return only the seed vertex
      and a value of :math:`0` will explore the whole graph.
    :param error: (optional) the acceptable error in the calculation of the approximate
                  pagerank. A smaller error will result in longer running time and
                  higher quality cluster.

    This method forms an important part of the :meth:`local_cluster_acl`

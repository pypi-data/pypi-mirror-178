class Neo4jGraph(graph.LocalGraph):
    """
    Represent a neo4j database as a :class:`stag.graph.LocalGraph` object.

    This provides 'local' access to the graph only. Given a node, we can query
    its neighbors and its degree.
    The graph does not support weighted edges, and it does not
    distinguish between edge types or directions.

    The neo4j ``<id>`` attributes are used as the STAG vertex ids.

    All methods which make calls to the database backend have a small cache of
    recent queries, meaning that consecutive queries for the same node will be
    fast.

A lot of this was amassed from many years of quickly looking into a thing™️ , jotting it down, and then just hoping we\'d remember why it was there later, so this is now a renewed effort in remembering all the thing™️s, and automating as much as possible. The idea is that it\'s faster, smaller, and easier to configure than it\'s ansible equivalent.\n\nHere\'s an example of the terminal after the script has run:\n\n[<img alt="screenshot of terminal after runnign onboardme. includes colortest-256, powerline prompt, icons for files in ls output, and syntax highlighting examples with cat command." width="750" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jessebot/onboardme/main/docs/onboardme/screenshots/terminal_screenshot.png">](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jessebot/onboardme/main/docs/onboardme/screenshots/terminal_screenshot.png)\n\n\n## Quick Start\nThe quickest way to get started on a fresh macOS or Debian OS is:\n```bash\n# this will download setup.sh to your current directory and run it\n/bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jessebot/onboardme/main/setup.sh)"\n\n# this will display the help for the onboardme cli\nonboardme --help\n```\nYou can also read more in depth [Getting Started docs](https://jessebot.github.io/onboardme/onboardme/getting-started) 💙!\n\n\n#### More Docs\nWe\'ve recently setup a justthedocs page [here](https://jessebot.github.io/onboardme/).\n\n### Upgrading\nIf you\'re on python3.11.0 or later, you should be able to do:\n```bash\npip3.11 install --upgrade onboardme\n```\n\n## Features\nMade for the following OS (lastest stable):\n\n[![made-for-macOS](https://img.shields.io/badge/mac%20os-000000?style=for-the-badge&logo=apple&logoColor=white)](https://wikiless.org/wiki/MacOS?lang=en)\n[![made-for-debian](https://img.shields.io/badge/Debian-A81D33?style=for-the-badge&logo=debian&logoColor=white)](https://www.debian.org/)\n[![made-for-ubuntu](https://img.shields.io/badge/Ubuntu-E95420?style=for-the-badge&logo=ubuntu&logoColor=white)](https://ubuntu.com/)\n\nOptimized for:\n\n[![made-with-for-vim](https://img.shields.io/badge/VIM-%2311AB00.svg?&style=for-the-badge&logo=vim&logoColor=white)](https://www.vim.org/)\n[![made-with-python](https://img.shields.io/badge/Python-FFD43B?style=for-the-badge&logo=python&logoColor=blue)](https://www.python.org/)\n[![made-with-bash](https://img.shields.io/badge/GNU%20Bash-4EAA25?style=for-the-badge&logo=GNU%20Bash&logoColor=white)](https://www.gnu.org/software/bash/)\n\nAnd built using these great projects.

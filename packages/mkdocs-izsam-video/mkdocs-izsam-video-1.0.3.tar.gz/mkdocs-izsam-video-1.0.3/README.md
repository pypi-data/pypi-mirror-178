# MkDocs IZSAM Video

This plugin is based on the Mikalai Lisitsa idea, please visit the page of the project at [https://pypi.org/project/mkdocs-video/](https://pypi.org/project/mkdocs-video/).

The plugin allows you to embed videos on the documentation pages using a simple Markdown syntax. This plugin allows to embed videos only in a `<video>` tag, if you need `<iframe>` or YouTube or third parties videos embed, please refer to Mikalai Lisitsa [plugin](https://pypi.org/project/mkdocs-video/).

## Installation

Install the package with pip:

```bash
$ pip install mkdocs-izsam-video
```

Enable the plugin in the `mkdocs.yml` file:

```yaml
plugins:
    - mkdocs-izsam-video
```

> See how to use [MkDocs Plugins](https://www.mkdocs.org/dev-guide/plugins/#using-plugins)

## Usage

To add a video to the final documentation page, you need to use the Markdown syntax for images with a **specific name** *(hereinafter ***marker***)*.

> See how to use [Markdown syntax](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/)

**Example:**

*content folder structure*

```
├── content
|   ├── ...
│   ├── video.md
│       └── videos
│           └── your-video.mp4
└── mkdocs.yml
```

*video.md*

Use relative paths for videos stored together with your content

```
# Video example

Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet

![type:video-tag](./videos/your-video.mp4)
```

## Configuration

### Marker

By default, the string `type:video-tag` is used as a **marker** in the Markdown syntax.

You can change this value by adding the following lines to your `mkdocs.yml`:

```yaml
plugins:
  - mkdocs-izsam-video:
      mark: "your-marker"
```

Now you can use this **marker** in the Markdown syntax:

```
![your-marker](./videos/your-video.mp4)
```

### Marker

By default, the following CSS styles are used for the `<video>` tag that is inserted into the final page:

```css
width: 100%;
```

You can change the style by adding the following lines to your mkdocs.yml:

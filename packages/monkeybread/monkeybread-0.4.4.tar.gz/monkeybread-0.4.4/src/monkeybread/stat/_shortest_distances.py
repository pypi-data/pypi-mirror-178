    """Calculates an expected distribution of shortest distances via permutation of labels.

    Calculation is the same as in :func:`monkeybread.calc.shortest_distances`. Label permutation
    excludes `group1`.

    If `actual` and `threshold` are provided, a p-value relating the proportion of distances under
    `threshold` in the actual data compared to the expected data is produced.

    Parameters
    ----------
    adata
        Annotated data matrix.
    groupby
        A categorical column in `adata.obs` to use for grouping.
    group1
        One or more levels from `adata.obs[groupby]` to use as sources for shortest distance.
    group2
        One or more levels from `adata.obs[groupby]` to use as destinations for shortest distance.
    n_perms
        The number of permutations to run. Defaults to 100.
    actual
        The actual distribution of shortest distances, as calculated by
        :func:`monkeybread.calc.shortest_distances`.
    threshold
        A distance threshold to use for significance calculation, in coordinate units.
    basis
        Coordinates in `adata.obsm[X_{basis}]` to use. Defaults to `spatial`.

    Returns
    -------
    If `threshold` is not provided, an array containing the expected distribution as described
    above. If `threshold` is provided, a length-3 tuple will be returned, where the first element
    is the array containing the expected distribution. The second element corresponds to the
    threshold, and the third element is the p-value calculated.

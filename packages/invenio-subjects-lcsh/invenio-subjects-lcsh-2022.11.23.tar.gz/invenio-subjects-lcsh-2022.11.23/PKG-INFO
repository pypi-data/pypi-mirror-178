        ## Installation
        
        From your instance directory:
        
            pipenv install invenio-subjects-lcsh
        
        This will add it to your Pipfile.
        
        ### Versions
        
        This repository follows [calendar versioning](https://calver.org/):
        
        `2021.06.18` is both a valid semantic version and an indicator of the year-month corresponding to the loaded LCSH terms.
        
        
        ## Usage
        
        There are 2 types of users for this package. Maintainers of the package and instance administrators.
        
        ### Instance administrators
        
        For instance administrators, after you have installed the extension as per the steps above, you are done. It should just work.
        
        ### TODO -- Maintainers
        
        When a new list of LCSH term comes out, this package should be updated. Here we show how.
        
        0- Make sure you have cloned this package. Then install it locally with:
        
            make install
        
        1- Update:
        
            make update
        
           This will
        
           1- Download the new list (TODO - For now download it manually and place it in `invenio_subjects_lcsh/download/data/`)
           2- Convert terms to InvenioRDM subjects format
           3- Write those to `invenio_subjects_lcsh/vocabularies/subjects_lcsh.yaml` file
        
        3- Run the tests just to make sure everything is still good:
        
            make test
        
        4- When you are happy with the list, bump the version in `invenio_subjects_lcsh/version.py` and release it.
        
        
        ## Future Ideas
        
        - InvenioRDM doesn't have a way to update pre-existing subjects yet. Once there is one,
          this package should provide the functionality to update LCSH terms.

## Typing stubs for html5lib

This is a PEP 561 type stub package for the `html5lib` package.
It can be used by type-checking tools like mypy, PyCharm, pytype etc. to check code
that uses `html5lib`. The source for this package can be found at
https://github.com/python/typeshed/tree/main/stubs/html5lib. All fixes for
types and metadata should be contributed there.

See https://github.com/python/typeshed/blob/main/README.md for more details.
This package was generated from typeshed commit `d633bebbf9b24e9037f008df0c1408bb0bb1f8b5`.

This also require that models have clearly defined scope and range of applicability.\n- Traceability\n\n  Ensure that the modeler is able to trace back the input parameters, code and script versions, etc., that have been used to produce a particular plot in a ppt or pdf.\n  Traceability is even more important in multi-scale and multi-model analysis.\n- Repeatability\n\n  Ensure that results presented at, e.g., a Conceptual Design Review can be reproduced at any later time.\n  Ensure that as-built models can be re-run at any moment during a potentially decades-long project life cycle.\n- Flexibility\n\n  Allow for different labs and collaborators to have/prefer different licenses.\n  Enable researchers to implement innovative ideas while building upon existing best practices, but without having to solve legacy issues.\n- Usability\n\n  Encapsulate the increased flexibility behind easy-to-use UIs for the standard design work.\n\nThe project implements a number of concepts introduced by the MBSE (Model-Based System Engineering) methdology.\nIn particular, MBSE shifts the focus from documents to models as primary means of communication in complex system design projects.\n',

description = """
This code is attached to the paper "Microbiome-metabolome interactions predict host phenotype".
We propuse a machine learning (ML) tool based on latent representation which predicts the log normalized metabolites
composition based on the log normalized microbiome composition. LOCATE has a higher overall accuracy than all current
state-of-the-art predictors in both 16S and shotgun sequencing. We propose an intermediate representation between the
microbiome and the metabolite concentrations and show that this representation can be used to predict the host phenotype
better than either the microbiome or the metabolome.

        It has five attributes including vertex label, primitive angle, measurement plane, 'domain_s', and 'domain_t'.
        Let :math:`\alpha` be the primitive measurement angle. After considering the dependencies to the
        measurement outcomes of some other vertices, the adaptive angle is calculated using the formula:

        .. math::

            \theta = (-1)^s \times \alpha + t \times \pi

        Note:
            'domain_s' and 'domain_t' are crucial concepts in the MBQC model.
            For detailed definitions, please refer to the reference [The measurement calculus, arXiv: 0704.1263].
            These two domains respectively record the effect of Pauli-X and Pauli-Z operators to the measurement angles.
            In other words, in order to calculate a measurement angle, the dependencies to the outcomes
            of some other vertices have to be taken into consideration in most cases.

        Warning:
            This command only supports measurement in the XY or YZ plane in the current version.

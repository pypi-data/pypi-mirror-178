# PyAEZ

PyAEZ is a python package consisted of many algorithms related to Agro-ecalogical zoning (AEZ) framework. PyAEZ tries to encapsulate all complex calculations in AEZ and try to provide user friendly, and intuitive ways to input data and output results after calculations.

# Installation

Now the package can be installed using `pip` command as below,

```shell
pip install pyaez==2.0.0
```

Alternatively, can be installed using using `conda` command as below,

```shell
conda install -c conda-forge pyaez
```

### Introduction

PyAEZ includes 6 main modules as below. Additionally to that, UtilityCalculations module is also included in PyAEZ to perform additional related utility calculations.

- Module I: Climate Regime
- Module II: Crop Simulations
- Module III: Climate Constraints
- Module IV: Soil Constraints
- Module V: Terrain Constraints
- Module VI: Economic Suitability Analysis
- UtilityCalculations Module

Other than 6 main modules and utility module, following 3 major algorithms related to AEZ also are included in PyAEZ. Those 3 major algorithms can be utilized individually without running whole PyAEZ.

- Biomass Calculations
- Evapotranspiration Calculations
- CropWat Calculations

### Dependencies

- numpy
- scipy
- gdal
- numba 

### Step-by-step Process

Following 6 Jupyter notebooks in the repository can be used as worked full example for PyAEZ 6 major modules.

- NB1_ClimateRegime.ipynb
- NB2_CropSimulation.ipynb
- NB3_ClimaticConstraints.ipynb
- NB4_SoilConstraints.ipynb
- NB5_TerrainConstraints.ipynb
- NB6_EconomicSuitability.ipynb

**Note**: _NB2_CropSimulation.ipynb_ takes a huge amount of time due to automatic crop calendar calculations. Hence, we have rewritten core parts of PyAEZ (_CropWatCalc.py_, _BioMassCalc.py_ and _ETOCalc.py_) with [Numba](http://numba.pydata.org/) compatible manner as well. Numba translates Python functions to optimized machine code at runtime, allowing calculation speeds close to C or FORTRAN.

# Pyrepseq: A python library for immune repertoire analyses

Pyrepseq is scipy & seaborn for studying adaptive immunity: modular implementations of algorithms for fast analyses, and bespoke plotting functions for compelling visualizations.

## Installation

Pyrepseq can be installed by obtaining the source code from [Github](https://github.com/andim/pyrepseq) and running `python setup.py install` in the main directory. If you install from source, you first need to install `numpy` and `scipy` if these packages are not already installed.

## Support and contributing

For bug reports and enhancement requests use the [Github issue tool](http://github.com/andim/pyrepseq/issues/new), or (even better!) open a [pull request](http://github.com/andim/pyrepseq/pulls) with relevant changes. If you have any questions don't hesitate to contact me by email (andimscience@gmail.com) or Twitter ([@andimscience](http://twitter.com/andimscience)).

You can run the testsuite by running `pytest` in the top-level directory.

You are cordially invited to [contribute](https://github.com/andim/pyrepseq/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md) to the further development of pyrepseq!

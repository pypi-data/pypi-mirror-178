Description: # Alibi-Explain runtime for MLServer
        
        This package provides a MLServer runtime compatible with Alibi-Detect.
        
        ## Usage
        
        You can install the runtime, alongside `mlserver`, as:
        
        ```bash
        pip install mlserver mlserver-alibi-explain
        ```
        
        For further information on how to use MLServer with Alibi-Explain, you can check
        out this [worked out example](../../docs/examples/alibi-explain/README.md).
        
        ## Content Types
        
        If no [content type](../../docs/user-guide/content-type) is present on the
        request or metadata, the Alibi-Explain runtime will try to decode the payload
        as a [NumPy Array](../../docs/user-guide/content-type).
        To avoid this, either send a different content type explicitly, or define the
        correct one as part of your [model's
        metadata](../../docs/reference/model-settings).

# Rag
*Make creating rest APIs in Django simple.*

Rag is a simple batteries included tool to make building rest API's using Django fast and easy.

## Usage

#### Quick Start

#### Command Line
The command line interface has commands to start a dev server, run development shell, run tests, run Django management commands, create an empty example project, and run a Celery background task worker.

#### Validation
  To validate a field you must start with a root validator: `to`, `am`, `accepts`, or `optional`.  All root
  validators check that a field is defined before proceeding with the exception of `optional` which will
  immediately accept if the field is undefined on the json object.

## Contributing

#### Lauching Dev Stack
Use docker compose to launch development stack.

#### Dev Setup
To install development requirements.
`poetry install`

#### Running Dev Tests
To run tests:  
`poetry run poe test`

To run a specific test or test file:  
`poetry run poe test -k test_rag.py`

To run a specific test in a suite:  
`poetry run poe test -k "test_validate.py and test_check"`

To see all print statements of passing tests use the `-s` flag
`poetry run poe test -s`

To run tests with auto reload:  
`poetry run poe test-watch`

To run tests with auto reload and specific test:  
`poetry run poe test-watch -k test_name`

Note: Errors like this might have a root exception with more detail and may mean you are missing migrations:
`psycopg2.errors.InvalidCursorName`

Enter template folder `cd ./rag/templates/large`
Run tests `rag test`

1) This function takes a positional arguments called "the_list","indent" and "level", 'the_list' is
any Python list (of - possibly - nested lists). Each data item in the 
provided list is (recursively) printed to the screen on it's own line.
2) A second argument 'indent' is set to default value 'False', which means indentation or tab-stops are not required
by default. If user wants to add indentation while printing the nested list it should be set to 'True'.
3) A Third argument 'level' is used to insert required number of tab_stops when nested list is encountered.
4) Fourth argument 'fh' is used to specify where the output of this function should write (place to write your
data to), a default value of this argument is sys.stdout so that it continues to write to the screen if no file object
is specified when the function is invoked.

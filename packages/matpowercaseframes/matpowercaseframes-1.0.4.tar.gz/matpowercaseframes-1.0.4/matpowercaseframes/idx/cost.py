#    The index, name and meaning of each column of the gencost matrix is given
#    below:
#
#    columns 1-5
#     1  MODEL       cost model, 1 = piecewise linear, 2 = polynomial
#     2  STARTUP     startup cost in US dollars
#     3  SHUTDOWN    shutdown cost in US dollars
#     4  NCOST       number N = n+1 of data points to follow defining an
#                    n-segment piecewise linear cost function, or of cost
#                    coefficients defining an n-th order polynomial cost function
#     5  COST        parameters defining total cost function f(p) begin in

#                    (MODEL = 1) : p1, f1, p2, f2, ..., pN, fN
#                        where p1 < p2 < ... < pN and the cost f(p) is defined
#                        by the coordinates (p1,f1), (p2,f2), ..., (pN,fN) of
#                        the end/break-points of the piecewise linear cost fcn
#                    (MODEL = 2) : cn, ..., c1, c0
#                        N coefficients of an n-th order polynomial cost
#                        function, starting with highest order, where cost is

#
#    additional constants, used to assign/compare values in the MODEL column
#     1  PW_LINEAR   piecewise linear generator cost model
#     2  POLYNOMIAL  polynomial generator cost model

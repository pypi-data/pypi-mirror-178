Description: # Chatbots
        
        This is a package which allows you to make conversational chatbots based on:
        
        - language model (like GPT3 in my case)
        - prompt giving the language model description how to operate
        - external search system (to search either through the intenet, setting-specific database and really early conversation history)
        
        You see code example in `dixie.py`
        
        ```
        Case: Hey, Dix. Remind me, why we call you Flatline?
        Dixie: Well, because I died and my brain was active only for few minutes. Then you scanned it and created an AI copy.
        ```
        
        Well, it's wrong, but similar to description.

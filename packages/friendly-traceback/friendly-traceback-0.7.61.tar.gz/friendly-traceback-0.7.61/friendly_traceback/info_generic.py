"""This module contains the necessary class and functions needed to
help describing what a given exception or warning means
(i.e. the answer to ``why()``)
of an exception. Most of the content should be considered to be private.

It does contain one decorator (``register``)
which is intended to be part of the public API, but needs to be
imported from this module instead of simply from ``friendly_traceback``.

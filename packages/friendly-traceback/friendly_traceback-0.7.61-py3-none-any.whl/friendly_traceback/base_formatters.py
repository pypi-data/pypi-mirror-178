"""
base_formatters.py
===================

This file contains the formatters included with ``friendly_traceback``.
Other formatters of potential interest, including a formatter designed
for IDLE as well as some making use of Rich, are included with ``friendly``.

A formatter is a function that takes two arguments:

1. a dict (named ``info`` everywhere in friendly files) containing
   all the information that can be shown to the user, as well as some
   entries that are meant to be used only internally as the full
   friendly information is obtained.

2. A second argument which is meant to convey what information should be shown.
   This second argument used to be a single integer ("verbosity level").
   It is currently recently being replaced by a single string. However,
   this might change as we experiment with various options prior to
   version 1.0

A formatter returns a single string. By default, this string will be
written to stderr; however this can be changed by the calling program.

This module currently contains 2 formatters:

* ``repl()``: This is used to print the information in a traditional console.
  The indentation of the traceback itself is chosen
  to reproduce that of a normal Python traceback.

* ``docs()``: this produces output with leading spaces so that it can be
  embedded as a code-block in a file (such as .rst). It can also be used
  to print the information in a traditional console.

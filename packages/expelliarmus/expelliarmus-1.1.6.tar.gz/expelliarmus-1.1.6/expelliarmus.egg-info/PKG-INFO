A Python/C library for decoding DVS binary data formats to NumPy structured arrays.

## Supported formats
- DAT (Prophesee).
- EVT2 (Prophesee).
- EVT3 (Prophesee). 

## Installation 
You can install the library through `pip`:
```bash
pip install expelliarmus 
```

The package is tested on Windows, MacOS and Linux. Join us on [Discord](https://discord.gg/JParSCNe5k) to propose features or to signal bugs!

## Quickstart
Shall we start practicing some spells? For that, we need a `Wizard`!


```python
from expelliarmus import Wizard
```

Let's cast a spell called `read()` and read [this RAW file](https://dataset.prophesee.ai/index.php/s/fB7xvMpE136yakl/download) to a structured NumPy array! 

```python
wizard = Wizard(encoding="evt3", fpath="./pedestrians.raw")
arr = wizard.read()
print(arr.shape) # Number of events encoded to the NumPy array.
```

    (39297796,)


The array is a collection of `(timestamp, x_address, y_address, polarity)` tuples. 


```python
print(arr.dtype)
```

    [('t', '<i8'), ('x', '<i2'), ('y', '<i2'), ('p', 'u1')]


A typical sample looks like this:


```python
print(arr[0])
```

    (5840504, 707, 297, 0)


If we would like to reduce the EVT3 file size, we can use the `cut(fpath_in, fpath_out, new_duration)` spell to limit the recording time duration to `12ms`, for instance:


```python
nevents = wizard.cut(fpath_out="./pedestrians_cut.raw", new_duration=12)
print(f"Number of events embedded in the cut file: {nevents}.") # The number of events embedded in the output file.
```

    Number of events embedded in the cut file: 540.


This can be verified by reading the new file in an array.


```python
cut_arr = wizard.read(fpath="./pedestrians_cut.raw")
print(f"Length of array extracted from the cut recording: {len(cut_arr)}.")
```

    Length of array extracted from the cut recording: 540.


The files are consistent:


```python
print(f"First original sample: {arr[0]} | First cut sample: {cut_arr[0]}.")
print(f"{nevents}th original sample: {arr[nevents-1]} | Last cut sample: {cut_arr[-1]}.")
print((arr[:nevents]==cut_arr[:]).all())
```

    First original sample: (5840504, 707, 297, 0) | First cut sample: (5840504, 707, 297, 0).
    540th original sample: (5853218, 1208, 253, 0) | Last cut sample: (5853218, 1208, 253, 0).
    True


The time duration is, more or less, the desired one (the events are discrete, hence we have not a fine control over them).


```python
print(f"New recording duration: {((cut_arr['t'][-1] - cut_arr['t'][0])/1000):.2f} ms") 
```

    New recording duration: 12.71 ms


What if you wand is not strong enough for handling spells on very large recordings? Well, we can try to read the files one chunk at time...


```python
wizard.set_chunk_size(chunk_size=512)
print(f"Length of the chunk: {len(next(wizard.read_chunk()))}.")
```

    Length of the chunk: 512.


Let's read less events, so that we are able to visualize them


```python
wizard.set_chunk_size(chunk_size=16)
print(next(wizard.read_chunk()))
```

## A small benchmark

Here it is a small benchmark using `expelliarmus` on the file formats supported. The data shows the file size, read time for the full file and read time for reading the file in chunks. The performance is compared against HDF5, HDF5 LZF, HDF5 GZIP and NumPy.

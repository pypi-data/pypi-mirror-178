- step(): action selection function, considered as input vsf used for the environment, instructing the kernel to act in the environment to go to the new state.
This function returns 4 values:
    +) observation: corresponds to the current state;
    +) reward: the reward received from interacting with the environment when performing an action;
    +) done: when the state limit is reached, if True, the simulation ends, False resets the simulation;

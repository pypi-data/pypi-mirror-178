# Al Adhan - Islamic prayer times API in Python!

Without any API keys, authentication, or registration, you can use this API to get the Islamic prayer times for any location in the world for free using Python, this project uses the [aladhan.com official prayer times API](https://aladhan.com/prayer-times-api) (thanks to them for the great work and free API).

<br>

I have made this API to convert the JSON responses from the aladhan.com API and simplify them to a Python objects and classes, so you can use them in your Python projects and they are easy to use.

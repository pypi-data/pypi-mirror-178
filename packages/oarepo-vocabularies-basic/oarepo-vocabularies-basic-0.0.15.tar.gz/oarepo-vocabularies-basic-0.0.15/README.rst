======================
 OARepo-Vocabularies
======================

An extension to `invenio-vocabularies` that adds
hierarchy to vocabulary records. It consists of three packages:

1. `oarepo-vocabularies` - supporting libraries
2. `oarepo-vocabularies-basic` - a generated vocabulary implementation
   roughly equivalent to the basic invenio-vocabularies record
3. `oarepo-vocabularies-model-builder` - an extension to oarepo
   model builder to easily use vocabularies in your own metadata model

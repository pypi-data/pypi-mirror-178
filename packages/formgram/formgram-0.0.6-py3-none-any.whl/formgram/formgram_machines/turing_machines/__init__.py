"""
A Turing machine is in this module assumed to be a dictionary with following keys

#. states:
    Is a set of strings for the internal states of the machine
#. alphabet:
    Is a set of strings which can be on the tape
#. control_symbols:
    Is a set of strings which can also be on the tape. Especially the `blank` symbol
#. initial_state:
    Is an element of `states` which is the state of a freshly started machine
#. accepting_states:
    Is a subset of `states` which decides if a halting machine accepts
#. blank_symbol:
    Is an element of control_symbols which symbolizes an unwritten cell on tape
#. transitions:
    Is a set of tuples which the machine uses to operate. Each of the entries
    is of the form ``(current_state, read_symbol), (next_state, write_symbol, head_move_direction)``


A configuration of a Turing machine is a Tuple ``(machine_state, head_position, tape)``
here

#. machine_state:
    Is an element of the states set of the corresponding machine
#. head_position:
    Is the index which shows where the read/write-head of the corresponding machine is in relation to the tape
#. tape:
    Is a Tuple of symbols from the alphabet and control_symbols set of the corresponding machine

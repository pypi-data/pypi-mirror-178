"""This package uses yacc to parse strings into grammar dicts

:examples:
>>> grammar_string = ''' # comments look like this and are permitted in the string
>>> <START> ::= <A> | 's' <START>
>>> 's''s'<A> ::= 's'<A>'s'
>>> <A> ::= <START> <START>
>>> 's'<A>'s' ::= 'a'
>>> <A> ::=  # this is an epsilon rule
>>> '''

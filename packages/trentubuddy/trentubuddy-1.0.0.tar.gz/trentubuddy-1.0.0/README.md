This is just a small framework to showcase web scrapers with a discord front end. Explicit use of the trentu.ca website, with permission to do so since it is public data and doesnt require backend access or login credentials. 

Be sure to use this in a virtual enviornment wherever possible

Besides installing pip to install this package (It will install the rest when you do) make sure you have a valid discord token to input when using the bot. This token is stored in a 
.env file and is not protected so use at own risk.

## QSimulator


This is a project to simulate Quantum Cryptography Protocols.

You can use of the classes *Qubit* and *Polarizer* to recreate processes
related with the measurement of a Qubit, so that it can be used in 
to create protocols as QKD.

There is a BB84 transference protocol simulation to study the Qubits behaviours.

    'long_description': '# todocom (Todo Comments)\nCLI program that retrieves all TODO comments from file(s) and prints them in terminal/shell. It was created in order to automatically update a list of TODO tasks by simply adding "TODO:" comments in the code. It also enables prioritization of tasks by using "TODO soon:" or "TODO urgent". \nTo create the TODO list, simply open terminal and run the following command:\n```\ntodo [folder/file]\n```\n\nThis command will print out all TODO comments that were found in the code, sorted by their prioritization: urgent, soon and regular. \n_Urgent_ tasks will be printed in RED, _soon_ in CYAN and _regular_ comments in WHITE to make it easier to read. There is also an option to filter comments by their priotization:\n```\n# Prints urgent TODOs\ntodo -u [folder/file]\n```\nOr:\n```\n# Prints soon TODOs\ntodo -s [folder/file]\n```\n\nFinally, there is an option to save the list in a text file (stores as regular text without colors):\n```\n# Store results in a txt file\ntodo -o [path/to/sample.txt] [folder/file]\n```\n\n\n## Setup\n```\npip install todocom\n```',

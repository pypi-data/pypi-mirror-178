Interactive BramBox
===================
IPython widgets for visualizing [brambox](http://eavise.gitlab.io/brambox/) annotation and detection dataframes on their images.
These widgets help with doing computer vision research in IPython Notebooks.


## Installation

```bash
> pip install ibb
```


## Widget List
Check out the [documentation][docs-url] for more information!

- **ImageViewer**: Image list browser.
- **BramboxViewer**: Brambox dataset browser. Browse through your annotations or detections for visual inspection.
- **PatchViewer**: Brambox dataset browser, but cut images in smaller patches (with overlap) for easier visualisation.
- **CutoutViewer**: Brambox dataset browser, but view individual annotations or detections as cutouts of the image.

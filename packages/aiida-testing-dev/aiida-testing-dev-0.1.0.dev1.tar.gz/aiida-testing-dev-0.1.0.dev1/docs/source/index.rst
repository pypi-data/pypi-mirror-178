The aiida-testing pytest plugin
===============================

A pytest plugin to simplify testing of `AiiDA`_ plugins. It implements
fixtures to cache the execution of codes:

* :mod:`.mock_code`: Caches at the level of the code executable. Use this for
  testing calculation and parser plugins, because input file generation
  and output parsing are also being tested.
* :mod:`.export_cache`: Uses the AiiDA caching feature, in combination with
  an automatic database export / import. Use this to test high-level
  workflows.

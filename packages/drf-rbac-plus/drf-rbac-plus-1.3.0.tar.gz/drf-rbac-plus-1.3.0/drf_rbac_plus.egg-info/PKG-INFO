# Django-Rest-Framework RBAC plus

**Based on the django USER model, a permission system based on RBAC mode is implemented, 
which provides a background admin entry mechanism for permission, 
and implements permission control with drf middleware.**

---


# Requirements

- Python (3.5, 3.6, 3.7, 3.8)

I **highly recommend** and only officially support the latest patch release of each Python and Django series.

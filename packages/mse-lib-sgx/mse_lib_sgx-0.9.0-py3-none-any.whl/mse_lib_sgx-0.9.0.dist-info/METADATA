# MSE Lib SGX

MSE lib SGX is basically the library responsible to start the mse app.

Its work can be broken down into two parts:
- Start a configuration server in order to enable the app owner to send some private data required to make the app working
- Start the app server containing only the app owner code. This server is started when the previous one is stopped.

The app server has three connection modes: 
- SSL using a certificate provided by the app owner
- SSL using a self signed certificate generated by the enclave itself. In that case, the certificate contains all the information needed to verify the code and the enclave trustworthiness
- No SSL: http only

The app owner code is given encrypted. 

Therefore, the configuration server enables the app owner to share these private data:
- The symetric key to decrypt the code and make the lib possible to start the app
- The private key of the SSL certificate if the SSL certificate is managed by the app owner

## Installation 

```console
$ pip install -r requirements.txt
$ pip install . 
```

> A Star Wars crawl component for Streamlit apps!

A wrapper around [`star-wars-crawl-greensock-with-hooks`](https://github.com/mandiwise/star-wars-crawl-greensock-with-hooks)
by [@mandiwise](https://github.com/mandiwise), using the
[`streamlit-component-template-react-hooks`](https://github.com/whitphx/streamlit-component-template-react-hooks)
by [@whitphx](https://github.com/whitphx) (credits to them! üëèüëè).

## Details

This is a small project putting together a "Star Wars" crawl component written in React and a React hooks-based template for Streamlit apps.

Why? The official documentation lists the class based components for React. React has released the hook-based API, which is arguably simpler and generally preferred over the class based components. Personally, I also prefer hook-based components over class-based ones. The project also uses `poetry` over the official documentation's `setup.py` and `MANIFEST.in` files - another personal decision.

## Features

- [x] Custom button
- [x] Custom intro
- [x] Custom episode text

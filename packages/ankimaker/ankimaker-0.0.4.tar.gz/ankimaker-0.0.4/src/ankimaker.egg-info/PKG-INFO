# Ankimaker

WIP

A CLI app to generate anki decks.

From csv file, with configurable parameters, filters and media.

From epub, finding difficult* words in the book and getting their translations.

*I still don't know what 'difficult' will mean. Probably difficult words will be less frequent words that are more frequent in the text than in some corpus, cut above a grade threshold. The grades will map percentiles of frequency.

| Language Level	| Number of Base Words Needed |
| ----- | ------ |
| A1 |	500|
| A2 |	1000|
| B1 |	2000|
| B2 |	4000|
| C1 | 8000|
| C2 |	16000|


This project is only possible because of the awesome work of genanki team.

I'm writing the document of this. Please do not use it unless you are someone internal.

## Install

You could either do:
```shell
pip install -U python-pycg
```

Or clone this repository and install it if you want to use newest features:
```shell
git clone --recursive https://github.com/heiwang1997/pycg
python setup.py develop
```

### Bonus

A customized compilation of Open3D will give you better experience including multi-window camera/light synchronization, animation maker and visualizer, scalar analyzer, and many more. Please compile and install my Open3D:

```
git clone --recursive https://github.com/heiwang1997/Open3D
python setup.py install
```

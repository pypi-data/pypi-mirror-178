# mOWL: Machine Learning Library with Ontologies

**mOWL** is a library that provides different machine learning methods in which ontologies are used as background knowledge. **mOWL** is developed 
mainly in Python, but we have integrated the functionalities of [OWLAPI](https://github.com/owlcs/owlapi), which is written in Java, for which we use [JPype](https://jpype.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) to bind Python with the Java Virtual Machine (JVM).

## Installation

### System dependencies

  - JDK version 8
  - Python version 3.8
  - Conda version >= 4.x.x

### Python requirements

  - Gensim >= 4.x.x
  - PyTorch >= 1.12.x
  - PyKEEN >= 1.9.x

### Install from PyPi

```
pip install mowl-borg
```

### Build from source
Installation can be done with the following commands:

```
git clone https://github.com/bio-ontology-research-group/mowl.git

cd mowl

conda env create -f environment.yml
conda activate mowl

./build_jars.sh

python setup.py install
```

The last line will generate the necessary `jar` files to bind Python with the code that runs in the JVM. After building, a ``.tar.gz`` file will be generated under `dist` and can be used to install mOWL.

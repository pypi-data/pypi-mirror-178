# MaxLog

#### Version 0.2.0

## Instillation

MaxLog is available on PyPi under an MIT License. It is installable via your favorite package manager:

### Pipx <span style="font-size:.6em;">(recommended)</span>

```shell
pipx install maxlog
```

### Pip

```shell└──
pip install maxlog
```

### Poetry

```shell
poetry add maxlog
```

## Usage

Basic usage is very simple:

```python
from maxlog import new_run

log = new_run()
```

It will generate the follow directory and files:

```
.
└── logs
    ├── log.log
    ├── run.txt
    └── verbose.log
```

- `log.txt` is a text file that is used to keep track of runs.

- `log.log` is a log that is filtered to the `INFO` level.

- `verbose.log` is a log that isn't filtered at all.

Every time `new_run` is called, it will generate the above file structure if it does not exist, read the current run number, increment it, record it back to disk, and then clear the console and print the current run number to the console as the tile of a horizontal rule.

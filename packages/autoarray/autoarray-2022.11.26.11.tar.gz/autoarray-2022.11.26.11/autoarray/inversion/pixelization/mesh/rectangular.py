        """
        A pixelization associates a 2D grid of (y,x) coordinates (which are expected to be aligned with a masked
        dataset) with a 2D grid of pixels.

        The rectangular pixelization represents pixels using a uniform rectangular grid.

        Both of these grids (e.g. the masked dataset's 2D grid and the grid of the Voronoi pixelization's pixels)
        have (y,x) coordinates in two reference frames:

        - `data`: the original reference frame of the masked data.

        - `source`: a reference frame where grids in the `data` reference frame are transformed to a new reference
        frame (e.g. their (y,x) coordinates may be shifted, stretched or have a more complicated operation performed
        on them).

        The grid associated with the masked dataset and Voronoi pixelization have the following variable names:

        - `grid_slim`: the (y,x) grid of coordinates of the original masked data (which can be in the data frame and
        given the variable name `data_grid_slim` or in the transformed source frame with the variable
        name `source_grid_slim`).

        - `mesh_grid`: the (y,x) grid of Voronoi pixels which are associated with the `grid_slim` (y,x)
        coordinates (association is always performed in the `source` reference frame).

        A rectangular pixelization has three grids associated with it: `data_grid_slim`, `source_grid_slim`,
        and `source_mesh_grid`. It does not have a `data_mesh_grid because a rectangular pixelization
        is constructed by overlaying a grid of rectangular over the `source_grid_slim` (it is therefore entirely
        constructed in the `source` frame).

        If a transformation of coordinates is not applied, the `data` frame and `source` frames are identical.

        The (y,x) coordinates of the `source_mesh_grid` represent the centres of each rectangular pixel.

        Each (y,x) coordinate in the `source_grid_slim` is associated with the rectangular pixelization pixel it falls
        within. No interpolation is performed when making these associations.

        The rectangular grid is uniform, has dimensions (total_y_pixels, total_x_pixels) and has indexing beginning
        in the top-left corner and going rightwards and downwards.

        In the project `PyAutoLens`, one's data is a masked 2D image. Its `data_grid_slim` is a 2D grid where every
        (y,x) coordinate is aligned with the centre of every unmasked image pixel. A "lensing operation" transforms
        this grid of (y,x) coordinates from the `data` frame to a new grid of (y,x) coordinates in the `source` frame.
        The pixelization is then applied in the source frame.. In lensing terminology, the `data` frame is
        the `image-plane` and `source` frame the `source-plane`.

        Parameters
        -----------
        shape
            The 2D dimensions of the rectangular grid of pixels (total_y_pixels, total_x_pixel).

        Mapper objects describe the mappings between pixels in the masked 2D data and the pixels in a pixelization,
        in both the `data` and `source` frames.

        This function returns a `MapperRectangularNoInterp` as follows:

        1) If `settings.use_border=True`, the border of the input `source_grid_slim` is used to relocate all of the
        grid's (y,x) coordinates beyond the border to the edge of the border.

        2) Determine the (y,x) coordinates of the pixelization's rectangular pixels, by laying this rectangular grid
        over the 2D grid of relocated (y,x) coordinates computed in step 1 (or the input `source_grid_slim` if step 1
        is bypassed).

        3) Return the `MapperRectangularNoInterp`.

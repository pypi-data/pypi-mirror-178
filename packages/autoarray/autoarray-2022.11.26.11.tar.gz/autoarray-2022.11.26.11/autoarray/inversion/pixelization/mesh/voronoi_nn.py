    A full description of this class is given for the class `VoronoiMagnification`.

    The only difference for this class is that when it is used by the `Mapper` to map coordinates from the data
    frame to source frame it uses interpolation. This means that every pixel in the data is mapped to multiple Voronoi
    pixels, where these mappings are weighted.

    This uses uses a natural neighbor interpolation scheme (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_neighbor_interpolation).

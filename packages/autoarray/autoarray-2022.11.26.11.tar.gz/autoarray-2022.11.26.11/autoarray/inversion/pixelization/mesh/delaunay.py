        A mesh associates a 2D grid of (y,x) coordinates (which are expected to be aligned with a masked
        dataset) with a 2D grid of pixels.

        The Delaunay mesh represents pixels as an irregular 2D grid of Delaunay triangles.

        Both of these grids (e.g. the masked dataset's 2D grid and the grid of the Delaunay mesh's pixels)
        have (y,x) coordinates in two reference frames:

        - `data`: the original reference frame of the masked data.

        - `source`: a reference frame where grids in the `data` reference frame are transformed to a new reference
        frame (e.g. their (y,x) coordinates may be shifted, stretched or have a more complicated operation performed
        on them).

        The grid associated with the masked dataset and Delaunay mesh have the following variable names:

        - `grid_slim`: the (y,x) grid of coordinates of the original masked data (which can be in the data frame and
        given the variable name `data_grid_slim` or in the transformed source frame with the variable
        name `source_grid_slim`).

        - `mesh_grid`: the (y,x) grid of Delaunay pixels which are associated with the `grid_slim` (y,x)
        coordinates (association is always performed in the `source` reference frame).

        A Delaunay mesh has four grids associated with it: `data_grid_slim`, `source_grid_slim`,
        `data_mesh_grid` and `source_mesh_grid`.

        If a transformation of coordinates is not applied, the `data` frame and `source` frames are identical.

        The (y,x) coordinates of the `source_mesh_grid` represent the corners of the triangles in the
        Delaunay triangulation.

        Each (y,x) coordinate in the `source_grid_slim` is associated with the three nearest Delaunay triangle
        corners. This association uses a weighted interpolation scheme whereby every `source_grid_slim` coordinate is
        associated to Delaunay triangle corners with a higher weight if they are a closer distance to it.

        In the project `PyAutoLens`, one's data is a masked 2D image. Its `data_grid_slim` is a 2D grid where every
        (y,x) coordinate is aligned with the centre of every unmasked image pixel. A "lensing operation" transforms
        this grid of (y,x) coordinates from the `data` frame to a new grid of (y,x) coordinates in the `source` frame.
        The mesh is then applied in the source frame.. In lensing terminology, the `data` frame is
        the `image-plane` and `source` frame the `source-plane`.

        If a transformation of coordinates is not applied, the `data` frame and `source` frames are identical.

        Each (y,x) coordinate in the `source_grid_slim` is associated with the three nearest Delaunay triangle

        a higher weight if they are a closer distance to one another.

        For the `DelaunayMagnification` mesh the corners of the Delaunay pixels are derived in the `data` frame,
        by overlaying a uniform grid with the input `shape` over the masked data's grid. All coordinates in this
        uniform grid which are contained within the mask are kept, have the same transformation applied to them as the
        masked data's grid to map them to the source frame, where they form the pixelization's Delaunay pixel centres.

        A Delaunay pixelization has four grids associated with it: `data_grid_slim`, `source_grid_slim`,

        If a transformation of coordinates is not applied, the `data` frame and `source` frames are identical.

        Each (y,x) coordinate in the `source_grid_slim` is associated with the three nearest Delaunay triangle

        a higher weight if they are a closer distance to one another.

        For the `DelaunayBrightnessImage` pixelization the corners of the Delaunay trinagles are derived in
        the `data` frame, by applying a KMeans clustering algorithm to the masked data's values. These values are use
        compute `pixels` number of pixels, where the `weight_floor` and `weight_power` allow the KMeans algorithm to
        adapt the derived pixel centre locations to the data's brighest or faintest values.

        Parameters
        ----------
        pixels
            The total number of pixels in the Delaunay pixelization, which is therefore also the number of (y,x)

        weight_floor
            A parameter which reweights the data values the KMeans algorithm is applied too; as the floor increases

    Note that data in multidimensional arrays is written in row-major order â€” 
    to make them read correctly by Fortran programs, you need to transpose the
     arrays yourself when writing them.
         -Not needed since I am writing them (nz,ny,nx) instead of (nz,nx,ny)
         -Could also be fixed by starting the arrays in row major order ('F')
           but I haven't experimented to make sure that's true

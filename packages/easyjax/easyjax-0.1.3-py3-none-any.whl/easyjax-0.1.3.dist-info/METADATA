# EasyJax 

> work-in-progress. 

EasyJax is a python package that facilitates machine learning development for JAX. It does that by providing:

1. A high-level API for machine learning workflows in JAX (specifically a trainer, experiment parent class). 
2. Several machine learning specific utilities for working with JAX (e.g., `ml.update_step`).

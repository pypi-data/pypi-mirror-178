## pyClever

This is an unofficial PyPI module for accessing the Clever chargepoints API, primarily developed for use with [Home Assistant](https://home-assistant.io), but I try to keep it as widely usable as possible.



As this is an unofficial connector module, using a non-public and undocumented API, this will be prone to breaking without notice - USE AT OWN RISK!
